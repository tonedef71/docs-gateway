The following guide describes how to install, register, and run Anypoint Flex Gateway in Connected Mode - all using Docker. Additionally, the guide describes deploying a simple API Instance with a basic authentication policy.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure that Docker is installed.

//Before getting started, ensure that:
//
//* Docker is installed.
//* Required Flex Gateway ports are available and permissions are assigned. For more information see xref:flex-review-prerequisites.adoc[].

== Install Flex Gateway

To install the Flex Gateway image, run the following command in a terminal:

[source,ssh]
----
docker pull mulesoft/flex-gateway:latest
----

The command installs the latest Flex Gateway Docker image.

== Register Flex Gateway

. Log in to Anypoint Platform with your registered account.
. Select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click on the *Flex Gateways* tab in the side navigation panel.
. Click *Add Gateway*.
. Select *Docker* and copy the code block in the *Register your gateway* section. The code block will contain your unique organization ID and token.
+
The following *Add a Flex Gateway* screenshot highlights the code block that should be copied.
+
image::gateway-quickstart-add-gateway.png["Screenshot of 'Add a Flex Gateway'",width=85%]
. Run the copied code block in a terminal, making sure to replace `<gateway-name>` with `flex-quickstart-guide`.
. Select *Flex Gateways* in the side navigation panel.
+
Your registered Flex Gateway now appears in the list of gateways.

== Run Flex Gateway

To run Flex Gateway, execute the following command in a terminal:

[source,ssh]
----
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)":/usr/local/share/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -p 8082:8082 \
  mulesoft/flex-gateway
----

Your Flex Gateway is now running.

== Deploy an API Instance

. Select *API Manager* from the Anypoint Platform menu.
. Click *Add API*, followed by *Add New API*.
. Select *Flex Gateway* as your runtime.
. Select the gateway that you registered.
. Click *Create New API*.
. Specify an API name and select *HTTP API* as the asset type.
. Click *Next*.
. For *Implementation URI*, enter the following:
+
[source]
----
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
----
. For *Port*, enter `8082`.
. Click *Next*.
. Click *Save & Deploy*.
+
Inside the gateway instance Docker container, all HTTP requests made to `localhost` on port `8082` will now be proxied to the `jsonplaceholder` service.
. To test the API Instance, run the following command in a terminal:
+
[source,ssh]
----
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --request GET 'http://localhost:8082/'
----
+
The command executes a `GET` request to the API Instance, and subsequently prints the resulting status code, which should be `200`.

== Apply a Policy

. While still in *API Manager*, select *API Administration* in the side navigation panel.
. Select the highlighted name of the API Instance created in the previous section.
. Select *Policies* in the side navigation panel.
. Click *Add Policy*.
. Select the *Basic Authentication - Simple* policy.
. Click *Next*.
. For *User Name*, enter `user`.
. For *User Password*, enter `password`.
. Click *Apply*.
. To test the API Instance _without_ authentication, run the previous `curl` command in a terminal:
+
[source,ssh]
----
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --request GET 'http://localhost:8082/'
----
+
The command prints a resulting `401 (Unauthorized)` status code, because the request does not include the Authentication context.
. To test the API Instance _with_ authentication, run the following command in a terminal:
+
[source,ssh]
----
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --request GET 'http://localhost:8082/' -u user:password
----
+
The command prints the resulting status code, which should be `200`.

A running Flex Gateway instance now secures an API with a basic authentication policy.
